## Problem 4
Write a report (no longer than a page) for each dataset giving your analysis of the dataset, your 
observations, and comments. You can be as innovative as you want. Minimally, the report should 
include a brief description of the dataset, the number of observations, missing values or not, the 
testing strategy deployed, the classification accuracy of algorithms, intuition developed by 
running the notebooks, etc.
